Breast Cancer Detection Using Deep Learning and Image Processing

This project focuses on building an efficient and accurate system for breast cancer detection using deep learning and image processing techniques. It leverages pre-trained convolutional neural network (CNN) architectures and Support Vector Machines (SVM) to classify mammogram images and assist in early tumor detection.

Model Architecture & Approach:

  Started with a modified AlexNet architecture.
  Tested with three optimizers: SGD, RMSProp, and Adam.
  Found that AlexNet with SGD gave the best initial performance.
  Fed extracted features into an SVM classifier for enhanced prediction.
  Evaluated results using a confusion matrix.

Extended Comparison:

    To improve performance and accuracy, additional state-of-the-art CNN models were introduced:
          ResNet50
          DenseNet
          EfficientNetB0
    All models were trained using SGD for consistency. After comparative analysis, EfficientNetB0 + SVM outperformed the rest in terms of classification accuracy and generalization.

Real-world Testing:

    Implemented a function to take random images from the dataset and predict if a tumor is present.
    Validated the model using external internet-sourced mammogram images â€” predictions were accurate and reliable.

Tech Stack:
    
    Python, OpenCV, TensorFlow / Keras, Scikit-learn, NumPy, Matplotlib

Results:
    EfficientNetB0 + SVM achieved the best accuracy (mention your accuracy score here if available).
    Confusion matrix visualizations demonstrated clear classification boundaries.
    Model generalized well on unseen images from external sources.

Key Highlights:
    Combined the power of deep learning (EfficientNetB0) with classic ML (SVM).
    Focused on real-world application: not just accuracy but also generalization to new, unseen data.
    Emphasis on optimizing models for practical deployment.
